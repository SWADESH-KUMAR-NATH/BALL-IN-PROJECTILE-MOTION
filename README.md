# BALL-IN-PROJECTILE-MOTION
 It is a simulation of a ball with initial speed 'u' with an inclination of 'angle' in degrees with the horizontal ground.
 We assumed that the ball losses its 20% speed with each collision with ground, which is given by the value 'elst'=0.8.
 The acceleration due to Gravity is taken as 9.8 m/s2
